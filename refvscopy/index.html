    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // let age = 100;
    // let age2 = age;
    // console.log(age, age2);
    // age = 200;
    // console.log(age, age2);

    // let name = 'Santosh';
    // let name2 = name;
    // console.log(name, name2);
    // name = 'Roushan';
    // console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    // const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // const team = players;

    // console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Lux';
    // console.log(players, team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // const team2 = players.slice();
    // team2[3] = 'Lux';
    // console.log(team2);

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    // const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    // const team4 = [...players];

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person; 
    // captain.number = 99;
    console.log(person);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99});
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person}

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const sant = {
      name: "Santosh",
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: "@wesbos",
        linkedin: "@sntshk"
      }
    }

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    // this makes a copy of the array
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));

    // In JavaScript, when you assign a variable to another variable and reassign the first variable to another value, the second one is not affected. This only happens with types such as string, bool, number, etc. 

    // But when talking about arrays, the update will be reflected in the first variable as well. Because the second array is just the reference to the first array.
